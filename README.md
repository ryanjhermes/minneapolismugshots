## Data Collection Schedule

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **6:00 PM Daily** | Scan Hennepin County Jail for new arrests |
| **24/7 Posting** | Post up to 8 inmates daily, every 3 hours |
| **Continuous** | Update public database with new records |

## Posting Schedule & Limits

The system operates with flexible 24-hour posting:

- **Daily Limit**: Maximum 8 posts per day
- **Posting Hours**: 24/7 (all day, every day)
- **Posting Interval**: Every 3 hours minimum between posts
- **Single Posting**: One inmate per post (no batches)
- **AI Filtering**: All mugshots analyzed before posting

### Posting Schedule:
- **Every 3 Hours**: Automated posting attempts throughout the day
- **8 Posts Max**: Distributed across 24 hours for better reach
- **Intelligent Spacing**: 3-hour intervals prevent spam and maximize engagement
- **Reset Daily**: Counter resets each day at midnight Central Time

*Note: Posts are spread throughout the day for maximum visibility and engagement*

## Intelligent Filtering System

Our system prioritizes the most significant cases:

üèÜ **Top 10 Highest Bail** - Focus on serious charges and high-profile cases  
üö´ **"Hold Without Bail"** - Prioritized as most serious cases  
üí∞ **Bail Amounts** - Sorted from highest to lowest dollar amounts  
üìä **Quality Control** - Only cases with both mugshots AND charges  
ü§ñ **AI Image Filtering** - BLIP VQA model analyzes mugshot quality before posting

## AI-Powered Quality Control

The system now uses BLIP VQA (Visual Question Answering) model to analyze mugshots before posting:

- **Image Quality Assessment** - Evaluates clarity, lighting, and framing
- **Professional Appearance** - Ensures images are suitable for public viewing
- **Technical Issue Detection** - Identifies blur, distortion, or other problems
- **Content Appropriateness** - Validates images are appropriate for social media

### AI Filtering Criteria:
1. **Image Quality** - Clear, well-lit, properly framed
2. **Professional Appearance** - Presentable and appropriate for public viewing
3. **Technical Issues** - No blur, distortion, or technical problems
4. **Content Appropriateness** - Suitable for public social media posting

## Anti-Detection Technology

To ensure reliable service:
- **Randomized posting times** (¬±1 minute variation)
- **Human-like delays** between posts (8-15 seconds)
- **Varied caption formats** with different emojis
- **Reduced posting frequency** for sustainability
- **Single posting mode** - Posts one inmate at a time instead of batches

## Why This Matters

**Public Safety Awareness:** Community members can stay informed about local arrests and criminal activity in their neighborhoods.

**Government Transparency:** All arrest records are public information. We make this data more accessible and searchable.

**Accountability:** Public oversight of law enforcement booking procedures and jail population trends.

**Research & Journalism:** Provides data for reporters, researchers, and advocates studying criminal justice trends.
